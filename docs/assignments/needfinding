# Social Media for Muslim Women for Beneficial Socializing

## Hunch:
How do I design an app that facilitates a safe and empowering environment for Muslim women to gather to gain beneficial knowledge and socialize? How to cater it to stay-at-home moms?

## Motivation & Planning
Seeking religious knowledge is obligatory in Islam. Islam also encourages women to participate in beneficial gatherings and foster sisterhood. After studying the topic, I was surprised to learn that for many centuries, mosques, in addition to being places for worship, served as social and educational hubs for women. However, I observe that nowadays, with globalization, emigration, pandemics, and other 21st-century factors, many Muslim women don’t have access to such gatherings. Thankfully, with the advent of the Internet and social media, Muslim women learned to utilize them to create virtual spaces for learning and socializing. These, unfortunately, don’t come without caveats, often compromising safety and religious values. Instead, I wanted to explore ways to create a platform that is specifically designed for that demographic and their needs.

## User Interviews
Although I grew up in a secular environment, I was privileged to have access to many learning resources and empowering spaces, including religious ones. However, I wanted to hear from people unlike myself who live in different geographies and from other walks of life. 

I also prepared a few conversation prompts to ask them.
Tell me about yourself and your religious background.
Do you use social media and if so, how? 
Do you find anything particularly beneficial or useful about that particular platform?
How do you gain knowledge about religion? In person, online?
Share your experience with women-ony Muslim gatherings.Is it hard to find them and why? What the interactions are like?

I wanted to give open-ended questions to the interviewees in case they discover domains I havent’ considered and used many follow-up questions to gain more insights.

# Needfinding

## Hunch:
How do I design an app that facilitates a safe and empowering environment for Muslim women to gather to gain <span style="color: #5E35B1;">beneficial knowledge</span> and <span style="color: #5E35B1;">socialize</span>? How to cater it to stay-at-home women?

## Motivation & Planning
Seeking religious knowledge is <span style="color: #5E35B1;">obligatory</span> in Islam. Islam also encourages women to <span style="color: #5E35B1;">foster sisterhood</span> that motivates and helps its members. After studying literature, I was surprised to learn that for many centuries, it was mosques that, in addition to being places of worship, served as social and educational hubs for women. However, nowadays, with globalization, emigration, pandemics, and other 21st-century factors, many Muslim women don’t have access to such gatherings. Thankfully, with the advent of the Internet and <span style="color: #5E35B1;">social media</span>, Muslim women learned to utilize them to create <span style="color: #5E35B1;">virtual spaces</span> for learning and socializing. Seeking knowledge became <span style="color: #5E35B1;">convinient and accessible</span>. These, unfortunately, don’t come without caveats, often <span style="color: #5E35B1;">compromising safety and religious values</span>. Instead, I wanted to explore ways to create a platform that is specifically designed for that demographic and their needs and concerns.

## User Interviews
Although I grew up in a secular environment, I was privileged to have access to many learning resources and empowering spaces, including religious ones. However, I wanted to hear from people from other walks of life. 

I prepared a few **conversation prompts**:
- Tell me about yourself and your religious background.
- Do you use social media and if so, how? 
- Do you find anything particularly beneficial or useful about that particular platform?
- How do you gain knowledge about religion? In person, online?
- Share your experience with women-ony Muslim gatherings.Is it hard to find them and why? What the interactions are like?

I wanted to give open-ended prompts to the interviewees in case they discover domains I haven’t considered and followed with more specific questions to gain more insights.

### Participant 1: Reyana
<div style="float:left; margin-right: 20px; text-align:left;width:300px;">
    <img src="C:/Users/Arzy/repos/portfolio-arzy/docs/assignments/images/avatar1.jpg" alt="Reyana" style="width:200px;" />
    <ul style="background-color: #f0f0f0; line-height: 1.2;">
        <li> 20 y.o. </li>
        <li> dental school student </li>
        <li> from Muslim-majority town in Russia</li>
        <li> born into a practicing Muslim family</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Reyana's experience with both social media and in-person women-only Muslim gatherings proved to be filled with insights. 

Reyana prefers <span style="color: #5E35B1;">Telegram</span> to other social media apps like Instagram or VKontankte for both socializing and educational content. She highlighted how she finds it versatile and <span style="color: #5E35B1;">non-distracting</span> in contrast with the addictive feed on the gram filled with often inappropriate music and images. She picks the channels and conversations she is interested in joining and sorts them into folders, which helps her keep everything <span style="color: #5E35B1;">organized</span> – essential for a busy student like herself. Focus on written content and the chat feature facilitate a more <span style="color: #5E35B1;">intimate connection</span> with other sisters and *“actually feels like talking to real people”*. After learning that Telegram is not common in the U.S., she exclaimed, *“What do they use then?”* On the downsides, she only mentioned ads. As a CS student, I found it really interesting how she has no privacy or security concerns, even when I hinted in that direction. Telegram has a reputation of <span style="color: #5E35B1;">lacking transparency</span> and having many ‘shady’ practices, so I would avoid sharing personal information, especially with untrustworthy groups. 

As for seeking Islamic knowledge, Reyana shares that she is “fortunate to live in a community with like-minded sisters.” She attends <span style="color: #5E35B1;">weekly gatherings</span> held in the house of the imam’s wife while men leave for the Friday prayer. Reyana says being surrounded by righteous women makes it much easier to not only learn about Islam but also apply the lessons to life. However, Reyana is sad to admit, because the imam's family travels a lot, many gatherings are canceled. Also, many of her friends don’t have such a community within reach, so in both cases, virtual circles become a refuge. She herself is part of a few Telegram groups like that. As opposed to a more traditional online lecture format, these virtual women-only gatherings tend to be <span style="color: #5E35B1;">extremely interactive</span> and expose her to a broader geographic and age <span style="color: #5E35B1;">diversity</span>. 

### Participant 2: Nigina
<div style="float:left; margin-right: 20px; text-align:left;width:300px;">
    <img src="C:/Users/Arzy/repos/portfolio-arzy/docs/assignments/images/avatar2.jpg" alt="Nigina" style="width:200px;" />
    <ul style="background-color: #f0f0f0; line-height: 1.2;">
        <li> 27 y.o. </li>
        <li> trained product manager but currently stay-at-home mom </li>
        <li> Uzbek American living in New Jersey</li>
        <li> ethnically Muslim but started practicing recently</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Nigina finds many applications for <span style="color: #5E35B1;">Instagram</span>. She has a <span style="color: #5E35B1;">blog</span> about immigration to the US, which became viral. She is aware that she could get yet larger following on Tiktok, but she didn’t find time to adapt to it since *"it's more for Gen Z"*. In addition to business benefits, Nigina follows many <span style="color: #5E35B1;">educational content creators</span>. For example, she learned how to take care of the baby solely from mom blogs. Interestingly, Instagram is also where she found Muslim female <span style="color: #5E35B1;">role models</span> who inspired her to learn more about Islam and start practicing.

Still, I am concluding that the interactions she gets from Instagram are not very personal because Nigina yearns for deeper connections. She recalls her college years when it was way easier to make friends. In the mosque, for example, she does not meet people like herself *“situation-wise, aspiration-wise”*. I found this comment interesting compared to Reyana's statement about how she specifically enjoys the diverse backgrounds Islam brings together in gatherings. Clearly, there needs to be a way to accommodate both preferences.

When it comes to seeking knowledge, Nigina talks with excitement about a  <span style="color: #5E35B1;">private online circle</span> she recently joined. In it, Muslim women come together to read the Quran and talk about it. According to Nigina, there are very few of them and she was really lucky to get a spot. Indeed, there seems to be a barrier for many women to access such opportunities, especially when they aren't actively engaged in the community like Reyana. Many of the online circles are not advertised and remain  <span style="color: #5E35B1;">exclusive</span>.


## Design Opportunities

Following the conversations, I identified several **design opportunities**:
- Ability to search for and join thematic circles, with the option to provide preferences and get best matches
<img src="C:/Users/Arzy/repos/portfolio-arzy/docs/assignments/images/page_layout.jpg" alt="Search layout" style="width:200px;" />
- For circle organizers, ability to customize the level of interaction with the audience
- Homepage where the user can see all her circles and the menu bar that divides circles into categories (e.g. Islamic knowledge, prefessional development, counseling)
<img src="C:/Users/Arzy/repos/portfolio-arzy/docs/assignments/images/menu_bar_categories.jpg" alt="Categories" style="width:500px;" />
- Feature that helps users plan their circle schedule around prayer times (Islamic lessons after dawn prayer)

| **Browse New Circles** | In the main page,you see circles you are a member of. You want to find new circles to join. Go to “Browse” and explore new circles. | This task tests the initial step for new users, as joining circles is the purpose of the app.. Observing this process will show if users find the navigation and layout intuitive for discovering circles. |
| **Join a New Circle and Post as Member** | In browse, find a "Tajweed Course" circle and join it. Then, navigate to it in "My Circles" and add an introductory post about yourself. | Joining and posting in a circle are key aspects of engagement in the app. This task checks if users can seamlessly join a circle and interact within it, offering insight into how intuitive the transition is from joining a circle to posting. |
| **Create a New Circle** | From the "My Circles" page, click "Create Circle." Fill out the form, and submit.

It will reveal if users can intuitively navigate the control panel from posts view, understand the unmute functionality, and manage call participation. |
| **Navigate While on Call** | While in a call, close the call to navigate to a post or another section of the app, and then return to the call. Now, end/leave the call. | This task tests the ability to multitask within the app while on a call, revealing how well users can manage their interactions without feeling disconnected. It also checks if the app allows for seamless navigation and return to the call experience. |
| **Assign Homework After Call** | After the call ends, assign homework to the participants in the circle. How would you do that?  | This task evaluates whether users recognize and utilize the posting feature for assignments. It tests if they can adapt posting for different uses.  |
| **Schedule a Discussion Call** | Schedule a discussion call in the circle you created, ensuring it aligns with Islamic prayer times. | Scheduling is a unique feature, especially as it aligns with Islamic prayer times.

## User Report 
The participant expressed positive sentiments about the division into “New Circles” and “My Circles,” finding this layout informative and intuitive. She quickly navigated between these two pages when joining circles and locating them in the “My Circles” view. This structure effectively facilitates user discovery, aligning well with the app's goal of fostering community engagement among Muslim women. However, the participant struggled with the search functionality, noting that relying solely on typing to locate specific circles was challenging. This gap highlights a breakdown in the gulf of execution, as the user’s expectation for an easy search experience was not met by the existing interface. Implementing filter options could significantly enhance this process.

While navigating circle posts, the participant found the experience clear, I think due to the familiarity of the interface.She also quickly realized that posts can be used for assigning homework and other logistical purposes, which I was quite surprised about. However, she paused when locating circle controls from the posts. This challenge indicates that there should be a more explicit navigation.

As expected. the calling feature proved to be more complex. The participant felt confused by the interface, especially without synchronized users during the simulation. The ambiguity surrounding the “Call Next” button exacerbated this experience, as its function was unclear until demonstrated through Figma. This suggests a need for more intuitive labeling or visual cues to enhance user understanding. When shown the “calling only” mode, she explained “Oooo, I love it”, emphasizing the value of providing options for multitasking users. Her enthusiastic response to the “listening-only” mode illustrates that users appreciate flexibility for passive engagement.

In terms of aesthetics, the participant noted that icons were helpful in navigation and that once colors are added. “Is it something we can you [with my friends]?” she asked.

## Design Opportunities

### 1. Limited Search Functionality

* **Flaw/Opportunity:** The search functionality for discovering new circles is inadequate, relying on typing alone without filtering options.  
* **Current Reason:** Users expressed difficulty in finding circles that match their interests quickly, as they cannot narrow down results effectively.  
* **Future Design Suggestions:** Implement filtering features ( by category, type, or difficulty level) to streamline circle discovery.  
* **Level:** Conceptual  
* **Severity:** Moderate

### 2. Ambiguity in Circle Control Navigation

* **Flaw/Opportunity:** Users struggle to find the circle control features when viewing posts, which leads to confusion.  
* **Current Reason:** The interface does not provide clear indicators paths to access circle management options, leading to frustration.  
* **Future Design Suggestions:** Introduce visual cues like icons to highligh how to transition to circle control from circle posts.  
* **Level:** Linguistic  
* **Severity:** Major

### 3. Confusing Calling Interface

* **Flaw/Opportunity:** The calling feature is perceived as confusing, particularly regarding the function of the "Call Next" button and user controls.  
* **Current Reason:** The calling interface is less familiar and intuitive compared to other app features, leading to user hesitation and confusion.  
* **Future Design Suggestions:** Redesign the calling interface with clearer labels for functions and separate controls for muting and switching speakers. Include disappearing write ups to help them understand the features better.  
* **Level:** Physical, linguistic  
* **Severity:** Major

### 4 Color Scheme and Aesthetic Preferences

* **Flaw/Opportunity:** Users found the color scheme too muted and expressed a desire for brighter colors in the interface.  
* **Current Reason:** The current design choice may not fully align with user preferences for a vibrant, engaging experience.  
* **Future Design Suggestions:** Conduct user research to identify preferred color palettes and implement a brighter, more inviting color scheme that enhances the user experience.  
* **Level:** Physical  
* **Severity:** Minor

# Replate

**RePlate** is a food-sharing app designed to **tackle food waste and food insecurity** by connecting those with surplus food directly to those in need, eliminating third-party involvement. By fostering a **culture of sustainability** and community-driven food sharing, RePlate encourages **meaningful exchanges** that benefit both individuals and the environment.

## Background 
**Problem**: [Up to 40%](https://www.usda.gov/about-food/food-safety/food-loss-and-waste/food-waste-faqs) of food is wasted in the US, contributing to rising carbon emissions. At the same time, [13.5%](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/) of US households experience food insecuity. While there are efforts adressing this issue, the existing solutions often rely on third parties, missing the chance to build community ties and destigmatize food aid.

![](./images/replate/foodwaste.jpeg)

**Solution**: RePlate bridges this gap through a user-friendly platform for direct food exchanges. Users can list and request as well as claim and offer items. Features like expiration dates, reviewing, and reporting ensure safe, equitable, and positive interactions.  

**Impact**: RePlate caters to diverse users, from home cooks with excess meals to farmers with surplus produce. It fosters sustainability, reduces waste, and strengthens connections across communities. With measurable outcomes like active user counts, food exchanges, and user satisfaction, RePlate drives real-world change ‚Äî one plate at a time.

# Development Process

## Needfinding: User Interviews

We prepared a brief interview plan for each interviewee, conducted the interviews, and took detailed notes, focusing on their motivations, strengths, needs, and blind spots. Participants were asked to share their background, their satisfaction with current food resources, and insights tailored to their expertise or experience: experts discussed food surplus issues, community solutions, and app interest, while users shared challenges with food access, community food-sharing experiences, and attitudes toward an app for improving food access. Key lessons were summarized to identify gaps and opportunities for creating value.

### Interviews Analysis 
The four interviews we conducted reaffirmed the need for a food-sharing app. All of our interviewees shared that they have experienced the effects of the **unequal distribution** of food before ‚Äì whether it was having too much food or not having enough. They have found ways to deal with it, yet often someends up in the trahs bin.

Many had **informal systems for sharing food** with friends, family, or neighbors. For example, Sarah is part of a campus organization called SCOOP that redistributes leftover food. Michael‚Äôs community has a counter where residents can place non-perishable ingredients to share. Sveta is part of a village group chat with 1000+ members, where people often post about food and produce that they are selling. However, these systems aren‚Äôt perfect. Sarah has found that her options are limited even with her network, in part because she has **dietary restrictions**. Michael complained that **fresh produce is rarely shared**. Sveta feels that it is **hard to find old listings**, as they are quickly buried under unrelated messages.

Additionally, some of our interviewees expressed **reservations about sharing food**. Sveta and Michael both mentioned that they would hesitate to accept food from a complete stranger due to **safety concerns**, and some are uncomfortable with asking for food because of the **stigma surrounding food security**.

After the interviews, we identified several opportunities to create value in our app. Some features that we would consider implementing are **allergy tags** to make the app inclusive of those with dietary restrictions. We would also like to find ways to destigmatize asking for help as much as possible, **create community**, and *foster friendships*. In order to create a sense of trust, we‚Äôd like to include a **reviewing system**. Also, to ensure safety, some **administrative actions** must be taken like content moderation and automatic deletion of expired items.


### Value Senstiive Design Analysis 
We used Value Sensitive Design (VSD) analysis to ensure our app aligns with the ethical and social values of its users and broader stakeholders. This approach, along with use testimonies, helped us identify and address potential harms, such as food safety risks or inequitable access, while also fostering positive outcomes like community building, trust, and sustainability.

- **Non-targeted Use**: Nefarious users may claim all the free food, leaving others without access and potentially wasting it themselves. Others might list spoiled or tampered food, risking harm to those who unknowingly claim it, or may be unaware that their listed food has expired.

- **Sustained Friendships**: Active app users with shared values (e.g., sustainability, cooking) can form connections, especially due to geographic proximity, fostering friendships both on and off the platform. The app should facilitate these connections.

- **Indirect Stakeholders**: Corner stores and delivery services may lose demand if the app fulfills certain needs internally, though these businesses serve broader purposes that the app cannot replace. Addtionally, over time, these businesses might also become app users.

- **Diverse Geographies**: Urban users can share surplus meals or event leftovers, while rural users, like farmers, can exchange surplus produce or goods, catering to a variety of community needs.

In the diverging phase, we "diverge" as much as possible and look at all existing solutions that we can draw inspiration from or identify potential gaps.

<details>
  <summary>üõí Too Good To Go </summary>
This design highlights the money users save and the CO2 emissions they prevent by purchasing leftover foods at the end of the day, reducing food waste. By offering this informational perspective, the app emphasizes the positive impact of users' actions and serves as a motivating incentive to participate.

  <summary>ü•ò Uber Eats </summary>
The filtering system is highly intuitive and convenient ‚Äî no typing required. With just one click, users can find exactly what they're looking for.

![](./images/replate/uber_eats_filters.gif){:width='400'}

Time estimation is very useful for busy people who are debating between ordering a single ingredient from a grocery store or asking neighbors.

<details>
  <summary>üõçÔ∏è Facebook Marketplace </summary>
Map view is nicely implemented: users can customize the local radius and only listings within that distance will be displayed.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>ü•ï Olio </summary>
    
The app facilitates the sharing and selling of food and household items. While it focuses on minimizing waste, it lacks a request feature, which could be more relevant for the food insecurity issue.

A mapping feature similar to the one in Facebook Marketplace is present in Olio, but it also groups items by location.

Vu there is paywall to see listings - why?
![](./images/replate/olio_paywall-to-see-listings.jpg){:width='200'}

Communities help build lasting friendships but shouldn‚Äôt be restricted like in Olio, where users must apply to join predefined groups instead of creating their own.

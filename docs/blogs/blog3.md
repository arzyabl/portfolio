I see your point about scaling interfering with a business’ original mission. It is something we talked about in the Value Sensitive Design lecture. A specific example was Waze. When it became really popular, their routing algorithms unintentionally affected residential areas with quieter roads by directing the traffic to them, thus making their residents – indirect stakeholders - angry with the noise pollution. Indeed, the intention was to solve congestion - a great cause, but scaling led to an unpredicted outcome. While the Social Innovation Design concept we discussed in the Design That Matters II lecture would probably suggest that the best way to solve this problem would be reevaluating and aligning incentives, as we learned, the way Waze addressed it was to claim that roads are a public domain.

You are right. Many social enterprise businesses, or businesses with “greater purpose,” have run into the issue of creating new problems and failing to address them in a praiseworthy way. 

But not all! 

For example, Airbnb was created as an app that offers an affordable alternative to traditional hotel accommodation. However, as it scaled, it in fact disrupted the hotel industry and housing market. However, the way Airbnb solved this (not sure if they chose to or were forced to) was by working with local governments to comply with new regulations and taxes. They also aligned incentives with hotels by partnering with them and creating “unique experiences”. I’ve also seen many hotels simply posting their rooms on Airbnb, so I guess that’s another compromise they came up with. 

Another one is Etsy. This platform was created to empower small businesses and creators. However, as it scaled, Etsy faced criticism for prioritizing profitability over its social mission, as many sellers used the platform for e-commerce. As a response, the company reaffirmed its commitment to ethical practices by implementing stricter guidelines for seller eligibility and creating new tools to support small businesses.

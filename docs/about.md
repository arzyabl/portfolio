## Background
Passionate about sustainability, technology, and design, I found a way to merge my interests in the Computer Science program at Wellesley College while complementing it with hands-on classes and undergraduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I work at the [Self-Assembly Lab](https://selfassemblylab.mit.edu/) at MIT, a research lab focusing on programmable material technologies. You can see the projects I am working on in the [research section](https://arzyabl.github.io/portfolio-ablaji/research.html) of the portfolio. I also tutor [Intoduction to Front-End Web Development(https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs204/)] at Wellesley College.
